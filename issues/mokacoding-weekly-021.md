Hello friend ðŸ˜Š You might have notice that no post nor email was sent last week. That is because I've been busy at [/dev/world/2015](http://2015.devworld.com.au/) and I run out of time. Sorry about that.

Speaking of events, on September 17 and 18 I will be speaking at [YOW! Connected](http://connected.yowconference.com.au/speakers/) and I would make me super happy if you came around and say I.

I would also like to plug [NSCamp](http://www.nscamp.com/) a social weekend for iOS and OS X developer in the beautiful and secluded Broken Bay Sport and Recreation Centre in NSW, Australia.

### [/dev/world/2015 notes of a testing fanboy](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/devworld2015-notes-of-a-testing-fanboy/)

I attended /dev/world/2015 in Melbourne this week. It has been a great conference, full of very friendly and smart people. Being a test and automation fanboy I attended as many talks related to that topic as I could. These are my notes.

### [Good, Great, and 10x](http://dbgrandi.github.io/good_great_10x/)

An inspiring post on what it means to be a good developer, what it takes to be a great developer, and where does the infamous 10x engineer fit in the picture.

### [Intention Revealing Methods](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3531-intention-revealing-methods)

In this, date but very interesting, article the developers of [Basecamp for iPhone](http://basecamp.com/iphone) share their experience writing methods that didnâ€™t serve to reduce duplication, but instead their purpose was to increase clarity, and how that worked out for them.
