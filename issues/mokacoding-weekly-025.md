Hi there, I hope you had a great week ðŸ˜Š.

So far the content on [mokacoding.com](http://mokacoding.com) has been driven by my curiosity and desire to share interesting findings, but I'd like to try something new. I'd like to know what **you** would like to read about. What can the blog do to **help you**? If there's anything related with software development that you think mokacoding should cover, please let me know by replying to this email, or hit me up on Twitter [@mokagio](https://twitter.com/mokagio). Thanks.

### [Tool: PathPicker](http://facebook.github.io/PathPicker/)

PathPicker, `fpp`, is a tool that you can pipe after a command listing paths to _pick_ them, and then run a command on the selected ones. For example `ls | fpp` will let you select files from the current folders then open all of them in you `$VISUAL` editor.
