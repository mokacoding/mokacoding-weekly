Hi, how was your week? Did you learn something new?

I finished listening to the audiobook of "[The Obstacle Is The Way](http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Obstacle-Is-the-Way-Audiobook/B00K252ET8/)" by [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/). I really recommend it to all of you. It's full of inspiration and motivation.

What I think I brought home from reading it is how important attitude is. We can see any problem as an opportunity to learn something new, stretch ourselves in different directions.

In the world of software development every bug found in the legacy code is an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the system, and to learn how _not_ to do something. In every estimation sessions with non technical people we can train our communication skills, to reduce technical problems to something that can be explained easily. Every back and forth with that person that never gives the thumbs up in the in the code reviews an opportunity to learn what they're looking for and address it next time.

I think this attitude towards life in general is very empowering.

And now, for this weeks interesting reads.

### [Taking a Pragmatic View of Isolated Tests](http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/taking-a-pragmatic-view-of-isolated-tests)

In this post [J. B. Rainsberger](https://twitter.com/jbrains) tackles the problem of convincing peers and management of the value of isolated unit tests from the angle of asking questions such as "_When I see a problem with a web page template, why should I have to worry about how to grab data from the database to display on that page?_". I find this point of view very effective.

### [Habits that Pay Off for Programmers](http://www.daedtech.com/habits-pay-off-programmers/)

You probably won't find any of the practices shared by [Erik Dietrich](https://twitter.com/daedtech) in this post a surprise, but I find it's good to be reminded of them. In particular "Understanding How Your Code Makes Someone Money", and "Reasoning about the Unhappy Path".

### From the blog: [XCTest closure based expectations](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/xctest-closure-based-expectation/)

Exploring how to write tests that wait for an expectation to be fulfilled based on the evaluation of a closure returning a `Bool` value.
