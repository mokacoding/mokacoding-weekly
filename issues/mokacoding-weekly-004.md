When talking about acceptance tests we can achieve this kind of clarity by having a 1:1 relationship between the tests and the acceptance criteria for the application.

We've seen a variety of links this week, but they all have a same theme: being more productive. There are many different way to be more productive, you could write code that is easier to read and reason about, reducing the time spent onto it; or avoid wasting time battling Xcode; or finally be able to tail a file and do searches on it from the same window.
