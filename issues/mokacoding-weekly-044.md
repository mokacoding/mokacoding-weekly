In this [Developer Tea episode](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/65866) host [Jonathan Cutrell](https://twitter.com/JCutrell) speaks about **feedback loops**. The shorter the loop the quicker we can learn.

This is as true while developing a new piece of software as it is when launching a product. That what's at the core of practices like TDD, DevOps, and Continuous Delivery. Shortening the feedback loop.

Over the week I suggest you look at the activities you perform trying to find ways to **shorten the time it will take to get validation on them**.

[Zach Mathew](https://twitter.com/zachmathew) from FreshBooks writes on how software should be built "optimizing your code for learning and change" (_again, feedback loops_).

_😱 what is a Javascript link doing in here, you might ask? There's a lot of cool things happening in the Javascript world, we should all keep an eye on it 😉._

Interesting interview with [Justin Searls](https://twitter.com/searls) on his experience as a software developer. Touching on the importance of testing and software craftsmanship.

### [📝 The story of getting SSH port 22](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/port)

[Tatu Ylönen](https://twitter.com/tjssh), inventor of SSH, tells the story of how he got port 22 for the tool. Interesting to see how the Internet worked back in the day.
