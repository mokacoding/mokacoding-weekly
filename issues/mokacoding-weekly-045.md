The other night I was cooking a pasta sauce. While caramelizing the onions I realized that I had forgotten to slice the mushrooms, so I rushed into it. By the time I was done the onions were slightly burned, and my mushroom badly sliced. Moreover, I hadn't started boiling the water for the spaghetti, which meant dinner would be ready later than what I had told my wife.

What's the point of this story? That you shouldn't come for dinner at my place?  _No, my wife is a wonderful cook and she won't let you down with burnt pasta sauce._

This little cooking adventure of mine seems a lot like what usually happens when writing code for a "story" or feature.

Had I spent a bit more time before starting my cook to make a plan of what to chop and in which order, I wouldn't have ended up delivering a slightly burnt sauce and late.

In the same way, if we spend a bit extra time doing planning of the steps we'll need to take and changes we'll need to make **before starting to write code**, chances are we'll avoid issues, deliver within our estimation, and overall have a much nicer experience.

[Barry O'reilly](https://twitter.com/barryoreilly) argues that the **rate of learning** is the most important metric for teams, business, and individuals. The faster you can experiment and learn, the more successful you'll be at knowing what is actually delivering value.

What's your team reaction when the build breaks? Panic? Indifference? Blame? Curiosity?

[Pavneet Singh Saund](https://twitter.com/pavsaund) explores the different attitude towards breaking the build in the CI environment, and what their consequences.

I definitely agree with Pavneet, breaking the build should be encouraged and seen as a learning exercise to learn (_see previous post_), and make the system more resilient (_see next post_).

[Mathias Lafeldt](https://twitter.com/mlafeldt) from the [Gremlin Inc.](https://www.gremlininc.com/) team takes a look at the discipline of "chaos engineering", originally formalized by Netflix.

> Chaos Engineering is one particular approach to ‚Äúbreaking things on purpose‚Äù that aims at teaching us something new about systems by performing experiments on them. Ultimately, our goal is to identify hidden problems that could arise in production. Only then will we be able to address systemic weaknesses and make our systems fault-tolerant.
