### Triple Espresso ☕️☕️☕️

In the last week my commute increased, and I got busy with (yet another) a side project. I didn't find the time to do enough research for a _proper_ post, so I gave myself an hour and picked topics from my [Espresso](http://www.mokacoding.com/espresso) posts backlog to write about:

* [How to update an Xcode plug-in for the latest version of Xcode](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/xcode-plugins-update/)
* [How to add an Hacker News button to your blog](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/hacker-news-button/)
* [Opening a PR to Bitbucket from the terminal](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/bitbucket-pr-from-command-line/)
