You might have noticed that last week there was no issue. That is because I was travelling and run out of time to write up a decent issue, so rather than sending out something I would have considered mediocre and waste your time I decided to skip. I could have sent a placeholder message but that would have been equally a waste, and borderline spammy.

Some of you have taken [the survey](https://goo.gl/forms/20rXsVVtkzQUqkqc2) to help me improve the newsletter, thanks a lot for taking the time. If you haven't yet I'd really appreciate if you could spare a few minutes to [fill in the survey](https://goo.gl/forms/20rXsVVtkzQUqkqc2).

If you'll be at WWDC next week I hope you'll have a great time 😎.

### [📝 All Thumbs, Why Reach Navigation Should Replace the Navbar in iOS Design](https://medium.com/tall-west/lets-ditch-the-nav-bar-3692cb17cc67)

It's very rare to see design related posts here, but I think you'll find what [Brad Ellis](https://medium.com/@BradEllis) has to say in regards to the navigation bar and its place in today designs given the size of the screen interesting.

As software makers we should strive to have an understanding of the basic design rules of the platforms in which we operate, and try to stay on top of the latest trends. It will enable us to have conversations with the designer we interact on a wider common base. Plus going outside of ones area of expertise is a great way to stretch the brain.

### [🎧 Fighting Influence Operations with Data Science](http://partiallyderivative.com/podcast/2017/05/02/influence-operations-data-science)

In this episode of [Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com/) host [Jonathon](https://twitter.com/jonathonmorgan) speaks with [Kris Shaffer](https://medium.com/@krisshaffer) and C E Carey (_for whom I can't find a link, if you have one get in touch please_) about their research into “influence operations” – propaganda campaigns run through bots that are changing the way conversations happen on social medias.

The number and extent to which these bots go is unbelievable, and the technicalities of the research quite fascinating.

### [📝 Readability Matters More Than Correctness](https://xph.us/2017/04/23/readability.html)

[Keith Rarick](https://twitter.com/krarick) makes the point that code readability matters more than its correctness. Do you agree with him?

### [📝 Self Code Review with Git Add Patch](https://dev.to/sharpshark28/self-code-review-with-git-add-patch)

Learning about `git add -p`, which allows to interactively stage hunks of code to be committed, drastically improved my ability to write small atomic commits, which in turns makes consuming and manipulating the git history simpler.

[Joe L. Wroten](https://twitter.com/SharpShark28) describes the technique in this post, and goes as far as calling it "self code review". I wouldn't quite call it that, but I encourage you to learn about this valuable technique anyway.
