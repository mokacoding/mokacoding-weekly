It's been a while, did you miss us? We're back from holidays ðŸ˜Ž  fully recharged and ready to share interesting ideas, tools, podcasts, videos, and everything else that can make us better at our craft.

### [Automation with pre-commit hooks](http://mokacoding.com/blog/pre-commit)

Git provides a mechanism to run one or more scripts before a commit is actually added to the history called pre-commit hook. We can use this hook to run scripts that validate or sanitise the changes to be committed automatically, saving time and brain power, and assuring the quality of the codbase and git log.

### [How Is Critical 'Life or Death' Software Tested?](http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/how-is-critical-life-or-death-software-tested)

An interesting overview and reflection on how _"life or death"_ software is tested, and how the process and techniques to do that are changing compared to the past. Fun fact, apparently engineers writing software for the Boeing planes tested it by... flying on the plane running the new code for the first time. That's proper motivation to write failsafe code!

### [Abstract vs. Concrete Parameters: Contradictory Patterns for Testable Designs](http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/AbstractVsConcreteParameters.html)

In this essay [Ken Beck](https://twitter.com/kentbeck) looks at what it takes to make software controllable, thus easy to test. The suggested design patters are abstract or concrete parameters. The two approaches are apparently in contradiction, but is it really the case?

### [Tool: SwiftCov](https://github.com/realm/SwiftCov)

The guys at [Realm](https://realm.io/) just released a tool to get test coverage for Swift projects, and it's obviously written in Swift.
