WWDC week, exciting times for iOS developer, and probably everyone using a Mac too. While other developers attend sessions and parties in San Francisco, here in the mokacoding office we're still at work to bring you quality articles, podcasts and much more! So let's dig into this very special issue.

### [The iOS Times - Issue 1](http://theiostimes.com)

**The iOS Times** is a brand new weekly publication that highlights the new and trending open source projects in the iOS ecosystem, brought to you by none other than... [mokacoding.com](http://mokacoding.com)! The mission is provide news and inspiration to developers looking _just for that component_, or for projects to contribute to. I'd love to hear what you think about it.

### [MailChimp automated workflow for mokacoding weekly](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/automating-mokacoding-weekly/)

In a burst of _meta-blogging_ this week's newsletter article is about the process to release itself, and the degree of automation it has. It's incredible what a couple of line of code can do to save us time.

### [Podcast: Giant Robots Smashing into other Giant Robots #149](http://giantrobots.fm/149)

In this episode [Ben Orenstein](https://twitter.com/r00k?lang=en) and [Chris Toomey](https://twitter.com/christoomey) have chat that touches many different topics, networking, mentorship, React.js, sustainable pace, Vim, refactoring, and much much more. A very nice episode, full of inspirations and interesting ideas.
