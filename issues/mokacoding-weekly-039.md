During the week I've been thinking about friction and productivity. If our environment makes it hard to do something, chances are we'll do that something less often.

**To become more effective we should keep our eyes open for points of friction in our workflows and aim to remove them.**

We could write a script to run that useful but hard to remember sequence of commands, or schedule those tasks which we're not keen on at a time of the day when we'll have the energy to avoid procrastinating and do them.

At the same time **we can introduce friction to avoid unproductive activities**.

Find yourself always on Facebook, Reddit, etc? You could use [a browser plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/delayed-gratification/ifhndomfnbmggdgodaicfebeggdphlcn?hl=en) to prevent you from going there, or put the app inside a folder, so that it's harder to reach. Eating too many unhealthy snacks? Try putting them in a box in the top shelf, or throwing them away.

### [TDD in Xcode Playgrounds](https://m.pardel.net/tdd-in-xcode-playgrounds-544a95db11e2)

[Paul Ardeleanu](https://twitter.com/pardel) shows how simple it is to run `XCTest` cases inside an Xcode Playground. Speaking of friction, this is a very low friction way to iterate on little isolated components driven by tests, since the Playground won't build the whole app but just the code needed for it, and does live reloading.

### [Waiting in XCTest](http://masilotti.com/xctest-waiting/)

Still in the `XCTest` realm, [Joe Masilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti) shows the new `XCTestWaiter` call introduced with Xcode 8.3 and how to use to test asynchronous code.

### [Bash scripting quirks & safety tips](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/03/26/bash-quirks/)

Bash scripts are powerful and portable, but the language is a bit weird at times. This post from [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk) has some useful tips to improve the quality of our scripts.

And speaking of shell, checkout [explainshell.com](https://explainshell.com/), a tool that given a shell command will parse its documentation and show the help text that matches each argument.

I wish you a great start of the week üëç.
