### [Enhancing XCTest test cases with Nimble matchers](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/xctest-nimble/)

Nimble is a matchers framework built for Swift that provides powerful and versatile expectations. Writing test within the standard XCTest harness but using Nimble assertions is easier and productive, and a good combination of tools to introduce testing and TDD to colleagues and teams in a frictionless way.

Great great episode of The iPhreaks Show, with [Jon Reid](http://qualitycoding.org/) aka [@qcoding](https://twitter.com/qcoding) as a guest. Jon and the host go through a nice chat involving TDD in the iOS world, full of pro-tips and inspiration.

### [Explicit Dependencies Principle](http://deviq.com/explicit-dependencies-principle/)

In the past two weeks we been talking about [explicit dependencies](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/explicit-dependencies-swift/), and this post does a way better job than me into explaining the advantages of such an approach. My favourite quote from the article: "_classes with explicit dependencies are more honest_" We should all write honest code üòÅ

[The Martian](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553418025/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0553418025&linkCode=as2&tag=mokacoding09-20&linkId=UIATU4F6N2CDAYCF) by Andy Weir is the story of an unlucky astronaut that ends up stuck on Mars by himself, and of all the hacks he does to survive. A great read for software developers, I really enjoyed the problem solving monologues, a kind of rubber duking in space.
