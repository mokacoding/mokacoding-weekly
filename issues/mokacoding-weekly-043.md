In this [Developer Tea episode](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/65866) host [Jonathan Cutrell](https://twitter.com/JCutrell) speaks about **feedback loops**. The shorter the loop the quicker we can learn.

This is as true while developing a new piece of software as it is when launching a product. That what's at the core of practices like TDD, DevOps, and Continuous Delivery. Shortening the feedback loop.

Over the week I suggest you look at the activities you perform trying to find ways to shorten the time it will take to get validation on them.

Interesting interview with [Justin Searls](https://twitter.com/searls) on his experience as a software developer. Touching on the importance of testing and software craftsmanship.
