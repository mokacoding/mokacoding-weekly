Hello all, this week is a **functional week**. The links below all have a functional programming vibe, but with very practical application. Let's get started!

<br/><hr/><br/>

### [Swift Functors, Applicatives, and Monads in Pictures](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/functor-applicative-monads-in-pictures/)

This is a traslation into Swift of “[Functors, Applicatives, And Monads In Pictures](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)” by [Aditya Bhargava](http://adit.io), which explains in a great visual way what these functional concepts are, and how they can be put into practice.

### [Video: Compelling Code](https://realm.io/news/compelling-code/)

In this talk [Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache), creator of [Quick](https://github.com/quick/quick), takes us on an API design journey, considering different approaches and the tradeoffs they make. Among the other things he shows how to use the Result type from the functional programming world to convey meaning and handle errors.

### [Video: An Introduction to Reactive Programming](https://vimeo.com/133250189)

In his lightning talk from July’s [Melbourne Cocoaheads](http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/) [Kevin O'neil](https://twitter.com/kevinoneill) gives a pragmatic introduction to reactive programming. I was lucky enough to be in the audience, and really enjoyed it.

### [Podcast: Build Phase #87](http://buildphase.fm/87)

During the latest episode of [Build Phase](http://buildphase.fm/87) [Mark](https://twitter.com/hyperspacemark) and [Gordon](https://twitter.com/GFontenot) chat about unit testing, what to test and how to test in, MVVM, and functional reactive programming with ReactiveCocoa.
