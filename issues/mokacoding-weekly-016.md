Hello all! I haven't done as much reading as usual in the week, because I got fired up with some coding that I hope I'll be able to share with you soon. But fear not, this issue of mokacoding weekly has links worth opening anyway, as usual ðŸ˜Ž Let's get started!

### [How to test UI changes in Xcode 7](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/xcode-ui-test-view-changes)

This Tuesday Xcode 7 Beta 4 has been released, with a little addition to the UI testing capabilities. In this post we'll explore what this is about, and how easy it is to leverage it.

### [Swift State Machines](http://www.figure.ink/blog/2015/1/31/swift-state-machines-part-1)

[@jemmons](https://twitter.com/jemmons) has a 4 part series of posts proposing a lightweight implementation of state machines in Swift which is source of great inspiration on how to encapsulate state in a way that makes it more controllable, and testable. The whole [Figure](http://www.figure.ink/) blog is very cool and I suggest you have a look around there.

### [Video: Improving Vim Speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnUiHLYZgaA)

This video by [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/) is packed of little tip on how to improve your speed when using Vim. What's your favourite combo?

And speaking of Thoughtbot, their iOS team just open sourced [Poppins](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Poppins) an app to collect and share GIFs, is written in Swift and uses a fair few functional concepts and patterns, so it is definitely worth having a look at the source code.
