The week post WWDC, the time in which many developers in the Apple ecosystem have flown back home and now have to balance the urge to play with the new shiny things with the need to get things done at work.

To celebrate that, this week we have WWDC inspired links. But before getting into them I'll ask you one last time to take the time to [fill in the survey](https://goo.gl/forms/20rXsVVtkzQUqkqc2) that will help me improve this newsletter. I'll close it at the end of the week, and you won't have to hear about surveys from me for a while 😜.

_To the links!_

### [📝 Apple's what new in Xcode 9 page](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html)

The Xcode release notes and "What's new" pages are always a great way to have a succinct overview of all the relevant changes that are coming in.

### [📺 Coursera's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

In my opinion [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) was one of the biggest and most exciting pieces of tech announced last week.

[Andrew NG](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg)'s Coursera course on machine learning has been recommended to me by many people, including a computer vision PhD friend, and it's a great place to start to have a foundational understanding of machine learning.

### [📝 Waiting in XCTest](http://masilotti.com/xctest-waiting/)

In [session 409, "What's new in testing"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/409/), among the many exciting improvements introduced `XCTestWaiter` is mentoined.

This new API was actually added with Xcode 8.3 and at the time [Joe Masilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti) wrote a great guide on how to use it to test asynchronous code.

### [📺 WWDC 2017 Essential Design Principles](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/802/)

This session held by [Mike Stern](https://twitter.com/themikestern) has been referred to as "[what design students learn over 4 years in university summarised into 1 hour](https://twitter.com/arle13/status/874197498562199553)", sounds like a good time investment wouldn't you agree? 😁.

I'm considering changing the name of this newsletter, if you'd like to here about it just reply to this email 😉.
