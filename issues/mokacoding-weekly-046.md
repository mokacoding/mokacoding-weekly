Over the past weeks I've been experimenting with the format in which this newsletter is written and delivered, and I hope you have enjoyed the results.

I have more ideas on how to make this little project more valuable, but **I need your help with it** üôè.

I put together a [survey](https://goo.gl/forms/2vXuAElmDU7s1Oom1) that will take you literally 2 minutes to fill. It will help me understand which direction to take and how to level up this newsletter.

I would really appreciate if you would take the time to [fill in the survey](https://goo.gl/forms/2vXuAElmDU7s1Oom1). Thanks üíö.

### [üìù Five Factor Testing](https://www.devmynd.com/blog/five-factor-testing/)

In this article [Sarah Mei](https://twitter.com/sarahmei) defines five ways in which tests can generate value for the team and the business. Sarah thinks of this list as a framework for discussing test strategies.

> When you‚Äôre looking at a test in a pull request or during a code review, think about which of the factors it supports, and which it doesn‚Äôt. Then you can discuss the test in terms of those factors ‚Äî are they the right ones?

### [üéß Avoiding Legacy Code with Michael Feathers](http://www.techdoneright.io/11)

A nice interview with [Michael Feathers](https://twitter.com/mfeathers) on the [Tech Done Right Podcast](https://twitter.com/tech_done_right) revolving around legacy code, tech-debt, what team can do to prevent this, and more.

### [üìù Unit Testing Nibs in Swift](https://medium.com/compileswift/how-to-test-a-nib-533d02847d78)

[Joe Susnick](https://medium.com/@joesusnick) shows how he works on Nibs in a TDD fashion. While I wouldn't recommend this approach I think the post is absolutely worth reading as a good example of the "red, green, refactor" cycle in practice.

### [üìù Higher order functions in Swift](https://craiggrummitt.com/2017/05/08/higher-order-functions-in-swift/)

A list of higher order functions, functions which can take a function as an input and/or return a function as an output, available out of the box in Swift compiled by [Craig Grummitt](https://twitter.com/craiggrummitt). It's always good to read through these list as we might find new tools for our toolbox, and refresh our memory of the ones we already know about.

### [üéß Principles of Curiosity](https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4569)

This podcast episode is unrelated with software development, but I still think you'll find it very interesting. [Brian Dunning](https://twitter.com/BrianDunning) from [Skeptoid.com](https://skeptoid.com/) introduces a mini framework to "_help decypher what's true and what's not_". The framework is made of three gates, which Dunning calles the _Three Cs_: Challenge, Consider, and Conclude.
