Hello everyone, I hope you had a nice week. While the tech community only talks about the Apple Watch (did you get one?) here at mokacoding we haven't lost our focus on testing üòé. This week a more descriptive approach to unit tests, and a look at process.

### [Better tests with Specta](http://mokacoding.com/blog/better-tests-with-specta)

Writing unit tests for our iOS and OS X projects not only is important, but should be always part of the development cycle. As such the way we write the tests is as important, and having the option to write tests that easily explain their purpose can drastically increase the quality of the suite. [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta) and [Expecta](https://github.com/specta/expecta) are two libraries that provide a different way to writing tests than XCTest, let's see what we can gain by using such approach.

### [The Art of Code Review: A Dropbox Story](http://www.objc.io/issue-22/dropbox.html)

In this article from March's [objc.io](http://www.objc.io/) [Ashley Nelson-Hornstein](https://twitter.com/ashleynh) tells us how every line of code gets written at Dropbox. Their process is very interesting and focuses on the interaction between developers.

### [They write the right stuff](http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff)

How do you write the software that **sends a spacecraf in orbit?** üöÄ How do you write software that if bugged kills people and wastes billions of dollars? The process at NASA is such that they write _software for grown-up_, and we could all take inspiration from the focus on design and on fixing not only the mistakes, but what permitted them in the first place.

### [Productivity Tool: Do Note by IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/products/do/note)

If you're into journaling, logging or just have some list that needs to be update Do Note by [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) has an interface focused on writing, and lets you append entries to the same file. I can also add timestamp and location, with link to google maps. And if you want more, have a look at the [other apps](https://ifttt.com/products) by IFTTT. My favourite recipe? Get a notification when the ISS is passing on top of your location.

That's all for this week, Easter is long gone, and you should have finished all the leftover chocolate üç´. It's time to go back into real business, and maybe tweak your process with a new focus on design and testing.
