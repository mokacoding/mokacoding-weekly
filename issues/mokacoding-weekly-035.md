### Ruby for iOS Developers - A two parts tutorial

Like it or not Ruby plays a big part in most iOS and Mac developers life. Tools
we depend upon like CocoaPods, Fastlane, and XCPretty are written in this
language. While being incredibly versatile, easy to pick up, and optimized for
developers' happiness, Ruby has some pitfalls when it comes to managing
versions and libraries. In this 2 parts tutorial we'll look at how to set up
your system and project to leverage Ruby tools effectively, across projects and
teams.

### [Use TDD to Pace Your Development](https://coderwall.com/p/pgkeoq/use-tdd-to-pace-your-development)

This nice post introduces the idea that practicing Test Driven Development
forces us to _slow down_ the pace at which we write new code, and focus more on
what the code that we are writing does, and how it interacts with the other
components of the application.

### [Swift: The Only Modern Language without Mocking Frameworks](http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/swift-the-only-modern-language-with-no-mocking-framework/)

If you've been in a conversation with me around testing you probably know that
I'm not a fan of mocks. This post looks at the reasons why mocking and stubbing
is not possible in Swift, and compares Swift's choices with other programming
languages.

While being happy with the fact that we cannot fall into the temptation of
mocking the world when testing in Swift, part of me cannot help but to agree
with the author "it would have been nice to have the choice."

### [Backing Thinkwards](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/backing-thinkwards/1060123207353876/)

In short post [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/kentbeck) shares a technique he's
been using recently, in which he "reverses causality" and imagines "what
refactoring is calling him from the future". It sounds a bit weird but trust me
it actually makes sense, and as all Beck's post, is worth the little time it
takes to read it.
