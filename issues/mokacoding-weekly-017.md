### [Moving Fast With High Code Quality](http://engineering.quora.com/Moving-Fast-With-High-Code-Quality)

The [Quora](http://www.quora.com/) engineering team shares their process guidelines. At Quora they have tuned their workflow to enhance the code quality, which is rightly seen as the main driver for a fast moving codebase. Quality and tidiness are so important that they even have events where the whole engineering team does nothing more that cleaning up.

### [TDD Case Study: Is Fast Better than Perfect?](http://qualitycoding.org/tdd-deferred-design/)

In this post [Jon Reid](http://qualitycoding.org/) brings us into a step by step TDD session adding a feature to an existing app, highlighting the tradeoffs he makes.
