A retrospective on my consulting business in 2015. What when well, what didn't and how to act on it, how to move forward in 2016. I think my personal experience could be valuable for every iOS freelancer, I have done a couple of things right that helped my business a lot.

### [Git-iquette](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/gitiquette)

There is nothing more frustrating than having unhappy users due to a bug that has already been fixed in a build waiting for App Review. [Rollout.io](https://rollout.io/?utm_source=iostimes&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=jan04) tackles the problem by allowing you to hot-patch bugs in production [without injecting any native code](https://blog.rollout.io/2015/01/rollout-io-under-the-hood-how-we-patch-your-mobile-app-in-production/?utm_source=iostimes&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=jan04), so their SDK is compliant to Apple's rules. You should definitely [give Rollout.io a shot](https://rollout.io/?utm_source=iostimes&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=jan04) and tell them mokacoding sent you.

### [Explicit Dependencies for Code with No Surprises](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/explicit-dependencies)

Sometimes the idea we get when reading a class interface is different from what is actually going on inside its implementation, for example there could be several hidden dependencies. Making a class dependency explicit in its interface is a useful technique to make the code simpler to understand, and easier to test.

Companion blogpost for my talk "Talking myself into the value of acceptance testing" at Melbourne CocoaHeads meetup

### [Fixing Bugs Driven By Tests in Swift](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/fixing-bugs-driven-by-tests-in-swift)

Unit and acceptance test are powerful tools that can be used to identify and fix bugs. Let's see how using a bugged Swift app as an example.
