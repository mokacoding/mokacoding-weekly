Hi! How was your week?

I am reading "[Talking with Tech Leads](https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads)" by [Patrick Kua](https://twitter.com/patkua), and this passages stood out to me:

> In my area of software development, memory is cheap, CPU is cheap, and complex code is too costly to maintain.

This is very true. Specially when working with teams, having code that is simple to understand and to work with can give an enormous productivity boost.

It also brought to mind this quote from [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/kentbeck):

> Make it work.
> Make it right.
> Make it fast.

Truth is, what really matters is shipping code that works to the users, to get feedback, validate assumptions, deliver value.

Often a first cut implementation, as long as correct, is good enough to ship, and can be refactored, restructured or rewrote entirely later.

### [Test Doubles – Fakes, Mocks and Stubs](http://pragmatists.pl/blog/2017/03/test-doubles-fakes-mocks-or-stubs/)

Like [Michał Lipski](https://twitter.com/milipski) I've seen a lot of different usages of the terms fakes, mocks, and stubs, and always found the lack of consistency a decrement to the quality of a test suite.

It's important to name things the right way, so that we can all have a common language to build on top of.

This post provides a clear definition of these tools, with a coding examples, and neat visualizations.

### [High Cost Tests and High Value Tests](https://medium.com/table-xi/high-cost-tests-and-high-value-tests-a86e27a54df)

In this post [Noel Rappin](https://twitter.com/noelrap) provides a number of tips on how to understand the value and the cost of our test, and how to maximize the value why minimizing the cost.

### [Mindful Software Development](https://dennisforbes.ca/index.php/2017/03/20/mindful-software-development/)

In this post [Dennis Forbes](https://dennisforbes.ca/) explores mindfulness and how it can be applied to improve the software we write.

### [iPhreaks 195: Keith Ballinger](https://devchat.tv/iphreaks/keith-ballinger)

[Keith Ballinger](https://twitter.com/KeithBa), director of PM for [Visual Studio Mobile Center](https://mobile.azure.com/login), speaks about continuous integration and deployment, focusing on how these practices can help us experiment and get feedback fast.

### [#DevOps and automating the repayment of technical debt](https://www.devopsguys.com/2015/07/31/devops-and-automating-the-repayment-of-technical-debt/)

[Stephen Thair](https://twitter.com/theopsmgr/) shows how starting to put automation into our codebases can enable us to payback technical debt and start a virtuous cycle that will constantly improve the quality of our software.

### [Using 3 Tiers of Continuous Integration](https://rhonabwy.com/2017/03/21/using-3-tiers-of-continuous-integration/)

"Not all tests are equal" writes [Joseph Heck](https://twitter.com/heckj) and suggests to split our test suite into 3 tiers: "smoke tests", "regression tests", and "deep regression, matrix and performance tests".

### [The Remote Manifesto](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/)

Our industry is becoming more and more remote. In this post the [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) team shares their 7 guidelines for successful remote work. Some of them are not just for _remoters_ though, for example number 5:

> Daily stand-up meetings are for bonding, blockers and the future
>
> Don't talk about what you did yesterday, this is not a reporting moment where everyone tries to look busy. Rather, kickstart the day with some bonding, solve anything blocking and share future plans so people can plan and act and ultimately save time.

If you made it this far and enjoyed the content I would appreciate if you could take the time to answer a simple question: "do you prefer this style of newsletter, with more articles and commentary, or is a shorter list with less details easy to take in?". Just hit reply to this email. I'm looking forward to hear your thoughts.
