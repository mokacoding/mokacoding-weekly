So, have you been diving into iOS 11 and Swift 4, or are you like me, still deep into building and fixing things?

Last week I caught up in person with my brother, whom I hadn't seen in person for more than two years. He's doing some Codeacademy courses on HTML, CSS, JS and Git. He asked me a few questions and reminded me of what it means to be a beginner.

I'd encourage you to set aside some time to experience the beginner mindset regularly. Need some suggestions? Try learning about hard core statically type pure functional programming with ["Learn you a Haskell"](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters), find out why many Rails developers are now excited with [Elixir and Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/), learn how to [speed-cube](https://eu.rubiks.com/speed-cubing), or [improve you knife skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydc_SaQ_eRQ). The list of things to learn is endless, you'll never be bored. 🤓

### [📝Enums as configuration: the anti-pattern](http://www.jessesquires.com/blog/enums-as-configs/)

I love enums, and some times have been guilty of overusing them. You know how they say, when you have a new hammer... In this post [Jesse Squires](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires) shares why he thinks using enums as configuration parameters is not a good idea, connecting his explanation to the [open/closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle).

### [📺 Types vs. Tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE1uVxLtGH4)

Are statically typed languages where developers lean on the compiler _better_ than dynamically ones which make you rely more on unit testing? [Amanda Laucher](https://twitter.com/pandamonial) set out to figure this out, and implemented the [bank OCR kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/) in many possible combinations of programming language and style. In this talk she shares her findings.

If you are any bit interested in backend development you'll probably have heard about "serverless architecture". [Pete Johnson](https://twitter.com/nerdguru) give a good introduction to what serverless is, and what benefits it can bring.
