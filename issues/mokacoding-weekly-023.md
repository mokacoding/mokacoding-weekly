### [Swift Optionals, Functional Programming, and You](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/demistifying-swift-functor/)

This is the article version of a talk I've been given in the past months. In this post we will demystify functional programming terms like monad and functor, and see how those concepts can be brought back to the every day Swift development, in particular how they can help to deal with optionals in a leaner way.

### [Podcast: Developer Tea on Automation](https://developertea.com/episodes/17209)

Another great episode of Developer Tea where [Jonathan](https://twitter.com/jcutrell) talks about how to use automation to improve our development workflow, and other ares of our everyday life.

### [Podcast: Mobile Couch on tips and tools for iOS developer](http://mobilecouch.co/66)

A nice chat between Ben and Jelly packed with tips and tricks.

### [Podcast: Giant Robots Smashing Into Other Giant Robots #164](http://giantrobots.fm/164)

In this episode Ben Orenstein interviews [Mirabai Knight](https://twitter.com/stenoknight) on her work around stenography, efficiency and using a steno keyboard for Vim.

Now I'm not going to suggest you go buy a steno keyboard and become super fast typist, but there is something very valuable that comes out of this conversation, the fact that any long term investment you make learning something that will reduce the cognitive load of your brain between the act of thinking and the act of putting the thought in the screen is a good investment and will make you more productive.
