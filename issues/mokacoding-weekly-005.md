Welcome back to another issue of mokacoding weekly, this week with have posts, podcasts, screencasts and talks, in Objective-C, Swift, and... Ruby. Let's get started.

### [Expecta, a matcher library that speaks English](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/expecta/)

A test that express is intent clearly is arguably twice as effective as one that doesn't. Writing test in an xSpec style is a good first step to express behaviour clearly, and when matched with a matcher library such as Expecta the results are test that are easy to read and reason about.

### [Specta global before and after each hooks (Updated)](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/specta-global-before-after-each-updated/)

An interesting and powerful, yet not at all documented feature of Spetca are global beforeEach and afterEach hooks. In this post we'll see how to configure them, and how to blacklist classes from running them. Updated for version 0.5.

### [Video: Ruthlessly Simple Dependency Management with Carthage](http://realm.io/news/swift-dependency-management-with-carthage/)

In this talk at [Justin Spahr-Summers](https://twitter.com/jspahrsummers) one of the authors of [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) goes behind the hood of how this new dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift works, and what is "it's philosophy". The strive for small and simple components really resonates with me, and it reminds me of all the Unix commands and the incredible way to combine them with `|`.

### [Podcast: Ruby Rogues: Limerence with Dave Thomas](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/204-rr-limerence-with-dave-thomas)

As a non-english speaker my first thought when I read the title of this episode was "another programming language I didn't know about". However _limerence_ is just an English word, and it means "_a state of mind resulting from romantic attraction, characterized by feelings of euphoria, the desire to have one's feelings reciprocated, etc_". In this podcast [Dave Thomas](https://twitter.com/pragdave) and rogues discuss about tools and the feeling of love that we developer have for them sometimes, together with strategies on how to stay sharp and how to learn new languages and frameworks.

This week's links differ in topic, programming language of choice, and media, but are all connceted by the same thread: trying to do better. And that's what we should do as developer, trying to do a tiny be better every day, across all our project, tools, and teams.

I wish you an happy end of April, and as always if you have comments, questions, or suggestions you can tweet me [@mokagio](http://twitter.com/mokagio)
