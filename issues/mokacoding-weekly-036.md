### [Getting Started With OHHTTPStubs](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/ohhttpstubs)

Following [last week's discussion](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/why-hitting-the-network-is-bad-for-your-tests/)
on the value of decoupling or unit tests from the network, here's a practical
guide on how to achieve that using OHHTTPStubs. I've been using this library on
many projects and always been happy with it, I am really keen to hear what you
think about it.

### [TIL](https://www.briefs.fm/til)

If you are enjoying the content shared on mokacoding, or like the weekly
digests from [The iOS Times](http://theiostimes.com/), then you'll love [TIL:
Today I Learned](https://www.briefs.fm/til). In this daily podcast never longer
then 3 minutes I share tips and gems on iOS development, testing and
automation, productivity tools, and random broader software development topics.
The show is in it's super early stages and I would really appreciate your
feedback

### [The Xcode Build System](https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/xcode_build_system.html)

Super interesting deep dive into how Xcode works and in particular how it
builds out apps. There is a lot to gain from having a clear understanding of
how a tool we use work, and this post and the its list of resources are a very
valuable read.

### [Software Engineering Radio: Andrew Phillips on DevOps](http://www.se-radio.net/2016/01/se-radio-episode-247-andrew-phillips-on-devops/)

Great interview with Andrew Phillips on the role of DevOps. There is a lot of
wisdom in what they, for example how automation and tooling are only means to
the end of building valuable software for the users, the fact that just because
a practice works for a company or team it doesn't mean that it will work for
us, hypothesis driven development, or the fact that "we are all friends", every
department and team of a company should be driven by the same goal of making a
great product that helps and delights its users.
